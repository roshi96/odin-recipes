# odin-recipes
This project is the first of all the Odin Projects.
This project is just a basic HTML recipe webpage.
The home page will display links to 3 other recipe pages.
Each recipe page will contain a seperate recipe and will
show paragraph, list and image elements.
Each recipe will have a heading of its name, an image of its finished state, a breif description, a list of it's ingredients and a list of the instructions of how to make it.
Also each recipe page will include a link to the home page.
